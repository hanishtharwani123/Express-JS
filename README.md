# Express.js Course

Welcome to the Express.js Course repository! This course is designed to help you learn and master Express.js, a powerful web framework for Node.js. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of Express.js and be able to build robust web applications with ease.

## Introduction to Express.js

Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features that simplifies the process of building web applications and handling HTTP requests. With Express.js, you can create servers, define routes, and implement middleware to enhance the functionality of your applications.

## Installation

To install Express.js, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Create a new directory for your project (optional):
```shell
   mkdir my-express-app
   cd my-express-app
```
4. Initialize a new Node.js project:
```shell
   npm init -y
```

5. Install Express.js as a dependency:
```shell
npm install express
```


## Router and Params

Express.js provides a built-in router that allows you to handle different routes in your application. You can define routes and specify the corresponding request handlers using the router module. Additionally, you can use parameters in your routes to capture dynamic values from the URL. This allows for flexible and dynamic routing in your application.

## Middleware

Middleware functions in Express.js provide a way to enhance the functionality of your application by performing tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling. Express.js middleware functions are executed in a sequential order, and they have access to the request and response objects. You can use existing middleware or create custom middleware to suit your application's specific needs.

## express.static

The `express.static` middleware in Express.js allows you to serve static files, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, directly from a directory. This eliminates the need for additional routing logic and makes it easier to deliver static content to your users.

## Parsing Form Data

Express.js provides middleware like `body-parser` to parse and handle form data submitted by users. With this middleware, you can easily extract and process form data, making it simpler to handle user input and interact with databases or APIs.
